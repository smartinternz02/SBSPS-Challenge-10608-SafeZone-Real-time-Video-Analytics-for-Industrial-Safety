![safezone_icon](https://github.com/smartinternz02/SBSPS-Challenge-10608-SafeZone-Real-time-Video-Analytics-for-Industrial-Safety/assets/76390896/bb399e5b-6310-4411-999c-47823b86fc0c)


## Overview

SafeZone is an innovative real-time video analytics web application developed to enhance workplace safety in industrial environments. By leveraging a combination of Flask, YOLO, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, OpenCV, and IBM Watson Assistant, SafeZone detects potential hazards like weapons, falls, and person with robber-mask. The system provides swift alerts to users and offers assistance through interactive chatbots.

## Features

- **Real-time Hazard Detection:** Utilizes YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection model to identify potential hazards in real-time.
- **Interactive Chatbot Integration:** Employs IBM Watson Assistant to provide users with immediate guidance and information.
- **Email Alert Mechanism:** Sends timely email alerts to users, containing relevant attachments such as detected images or video frames.
- **Proactive Prevention:** Detects hazards as they occur, enabling organizations to take preventive measures and enhance workplace safety.
- **Multi-Class Detection:** Trained YOLO model to recognize three distinct classes: weapon detection, fall-detection, and robber-mask detection.

## Usage

1. Run the application: `python app.py`
2. Access the application via your web browser at `http://localhost:5000`
